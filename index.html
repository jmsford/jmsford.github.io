  Welcome to the 24/7 Wayne-M Deathrun Server, your nonstop destination for adrenaline-fueled death games in the TF2 universe.  
  Powered by custom scripts and exclusive trap sequences, our server delivers an unmatched Deathrun experience.  
  Each round pits RED runners against a lone BLU controllerâ€”will you survive the traps or perish in agony?  
  Featuring over 30 unique maps, each filled with elaborate killzones, puzzles, and jump-scares.  
  Custom deaths include iconic characters like Jeff the Killer and Freddy Fazbear with voice lines and animated entrances.  
  Ranks, achievements, and death logs are tracked via our proprietary stats system updated in real-time.  
  Server moderation is active 24/7, with admins ensuring fair play and banning exploiters on sight.  
  Frequent events include Speedrun Sundays, Nightmare Mode, and Map Voting Marathons.  
  Built on a lag-free tick-boosted engine, all traps are frame-perfect and synced server-wide.  
  Whether you're a veteran trigger dodger or a new recruit, Wayne-M welcomes all who dare.
